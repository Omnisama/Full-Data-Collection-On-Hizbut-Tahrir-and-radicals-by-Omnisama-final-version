The radical Islamist movements in Bangladesh—including
Khilafat movements, Touhidi Janata, Hizb ut-Tahrir, and others—are not isolated incidents but
interconnected parts of a nationwide destabilization effort. This is a multi-layered operation with
both street-level missions and well-organized propaganda networks, aiming to gradually push
the country toward jihadist mobilization and potential armed uprisings.
